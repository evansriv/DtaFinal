C E 392D Final Project
Multi-Class CTM
10 May, 2018

These are the python files for the multi-class CTM Model we developed.
Most significant changes happened in linkModel.py, specifically in the CellTransmissionModelLink class.
We change the backward wave speed, jam density, and capacity of links to reflect the changes developed in our model.

Most of the code was developed by Dr. Stephen Boyles at UT Austin for his Dynamic Traffic Assignment course in Spring 2018.
